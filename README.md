This is an implementation of a bottom sheet as commonly seen in iOS 12. STIBottomSheet is work in Progress and might not implement all the functionality you need, but I wanted to share it anyways, because it might already be a great starting point. Contributions are very welcome :)

Here is a demo of STIBottomSheet in a protoype for a route planning app I'm currently building:

The sheet is completely managed by the Framework, the content of the sheet is a child view controller provided by the app. Drag handle and close button are provided by the framework. See the example project for usage details. 

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

STIBottomSheet is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'STIBottomSheet'
```
